This project is a ‘search engine’ with an in built portal and social networking under the name, Contribute for a Cause. This web application is created on the idea of reusability of things. The three different components are for different purposes, which are given below:

I.	Shree Amba Search Engine: It is used to carry out a three way search, to search for NGOs in your Country, your state and your city and according to the things you want to contribute. The NGO can search for a contributor and the contributor can search for an NGO. You can also search the web using custom search.

II.	User accounts: It is like a social networking section which provides a Contributor and an NGO, their respective account so that they can communicate with each other. It helps in making handshakes between the Contributor and the NGO.

III.	Portal: The portal provides complete information about the Contribution Process. It ensures the Contributor about the authenticity of the process. It allows users to see the list of NGOs and Contributors using the portal. It allows the user to peep into the experiences of the beneficiaries and the Sajjan Shakti. It allows users to experience the pleasure of giving. It allows the users to celebrate festivals with them, participate in their exhibitions, visit their places, exploit business opportunities and organize picnics and excursions.

IV.	Blog: The blog allows the users and the administrator, to post the recent updates, reply to the posts, clear the doubts and build an archive.

You may be anyone doing a certain work in a certain field. At any time, you have things with you that may not be useful to you anymore but may be very useful to an NGO providing a particular service and require those things frequently.






For Example:

I.	You may be a student who has passed a certain class and moved to the next or has changed his stream or you may be professional who has books with him from his old education days. These books might not be useful to you anymore and you might be thinking to sell them to a Kabadi Wala or to a book seller at a price that is not worth the value, the book the book might have for an NGO that deals in primary or secondary education. The same useless books may provide education to millions of others.

II.	You may be the owner of a cyber café or a personal computer user that may update its systems, tablets or phones to the latest. The old stuff might not be any value to you or may earn you 100 bucks. But it may be much more useful to an NGO providing computer education to the needy.


III.	You may be the owner of an organization whose organization is undergoing a major architectural change and you may have a lot of old and spare furniture which may not be of much value to you but may be very useful to NGOs that do not have any infrastructure to offer their services properly.

IV.	You may be a fresh doctor who may want to treat more patients to gain expertise. You can offer your services for free to the ill in these NGOs, where there is a lack of medical services and doctors.



V.	You may be a fresh computer graduate. You can offer to make window and web applications for these NGOs for free as your projects like me! You may set up and administer an intranet for them.

VI.	You may a teacher who loves to teach and especially to those who really value education. You can teach through a virtual classroom.



CONTRIBUTE FOR A CAUSE is a nonprofit platform that allows you to contribute these things and services to NGOs at the convenience of your doorstep! The Society has given us name, identity, culture, customs, resources, livelihood, anything and everything we can think of. Now it’s our turn to return the favor. We can’t expect anything from our government and can’t rely on them. It’s our responsibility also to contribute to the society and raise the standard of the underprivileged.
